LEGEND:
  <REPOSITORY_NAME> = The name of your repository as decided in 
	   	      github when the repository was created.
  		      For learning JavaScript example project, the
		      name was "LearningJS"

  <USERNAME> = github username, currently "spailll"

  <REMOTE_URL> = git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git

		 EX: git@github.com:spailll/LearningJS.git
		     For my learning github repository, after
                     creating the repository named LearningJS 
 		     on the github website, completely empty with
		     no README.md, no License, and no .gitignore.

CREATING A NEW LOCAL REPOSITORY
	> git init -b main
	> git commit -am "First Commit"
	> git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL> 
	> git push -u origin main

JUST CLONED A REPOSITORY
	> git commit -am "test"
	> git remote -v
		if both fetch and push are using https rather than 
		git@ use
	> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:spailll/<REPO>.git
	> git push -u origin main

GITHUB'S RECOMMENDED METHOD
  1.	Create Completely Empty Github Repo With no README.md,
      	no .gitignore and no License.

  2. 	> echo "# <REPOSITORY_NAME>" >> README.md

  3. 	> git init

  4.	> git add README.md

  5. 	> git commit -m "First Commit"

  6. 	> git branch -M main

  7.  > git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>

  8.	> git push -u origin main

LOGGING IN TO GIT
	> git config --global user.name "spailll"
	> git config --global user.email "bsailor@okstate.edu"

CHECKING FOR SSH KEYS
	> ls -al ~/.ssh
		if id_rsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, or id_ed25519.pub exist
		Then there is already a key pair.

SSH KEY GENERATION
  1. 	Check for existing keys ^^

  2.	> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     //For Legacy Systems that don't support Ed25519 algorithm, 
     //Instead use:
	> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

  3. 	It prompts you to enter a file to save the key, Press
	Enter to use the default option. (Press Enter)

  4. 	It then prompts you to enter a passphrase, Enter one
   	And then re-enter it when prompted. REMEMBER THIS!!

  5.    Start the ssh-agent in the background:
	> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	Should respond > Agent pid #####

  6. 	Add private key to the ssh agent
		> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
	//For Legacy Systems, the name will be id_rsa (I Think**)
     
ADDING THE SSH KEY TO GITHUB
  1.	Copy to clipboard the output of command:
		> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

  2. 	Go to github.com, Login, and go to settings. Go to the 
		SSH and GPG Keys section. Click New SSH Key or Add SSH Key
	
  3. 	Add a descriptive title and paste the entire output from the
		cat command in step 1 in the Key section.

  4. 	Pick Authentication Key or Signature Key
		Auth-key - Used for pulling
		Sig-Key  - Used for signing commits and pushes
		Make both if unsure.


LOCAL VERSION IS OUTDATED:
  1.	Make sure you are on the right branch
		> git checkout branch-name

  2.	> git fetch

  3.	To see the differences between your local and remote branch
		> git diff branch-name..origin/branch-name
		For side by side
		> git diff --color-words branch-name..origin/branch-name

  4.	> git merge origin/branch-name
		Resolve any conflicts and use git add, then continue
		> git merge --continue

  5.	Test It!
