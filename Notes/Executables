Making Executables Globally Executable:
  1) Compile your C++ Program using: 
        $ g++ your_program.cpp -o your_program

  2) Create a bin directory for custom executables if one does not
     already exist, use:
        $ mkdir ~/bin

  3) Move the compiled executable to a directory in your 'PATH', ~/bin
        $ mv your_program ~/bin

  4) Add the ~/bin directory to your 'PATH'. Edit your shell conf file
     ~/.bashrc and add the following line to the end:
          export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

  5) Save and close the file. Apply the changes to the current
     terminal session by using 
        $ source ~/.bashrc

Note: If you already have a ~/bin file that is linked to the 'PATH', 
      just do steps (3) and (5).
