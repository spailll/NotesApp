after making sure that there is no 
user error in typing the username or 
password, try
  $ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
          Find the section that says
          Authentication, and change
          the option that says 
          "PermitRootLogin*" to 
          "PermitRootLogin yes"
          save and close
